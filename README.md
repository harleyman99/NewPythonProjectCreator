# NewPythonProjectCreator


This is a simple project I am working on to allow you to give your Python Project a name and the program will great all of the files you need including the READ.ME.

Once the project is created Visual Studio Code will open and you can begin coding right away.

Add the path of the new project to your GitHib desk top and the files will show as you are working on them. 

If you find this program useful please reach out to me and let me know.

# NewPythonProjectCreator


This is a simple project I am working on to allow you to give your Python Project a name and the program will create all of the files you need including the READ.ME.

**Program Updated 12-3-2022: If you are using this on Windows the program will now create the new program directory and create a new Virtual Enviorment.** 

Once the project is created Visual Studio Code will open and you can begin coding right away.

Add the path of the new project to your GitHib desk top and the files will show as you are working on them. 

If you find this program useful please reach out to me and let me know.

Working on an update to have this program aso create the virtual enviorment. 


Future Plans 12-3-2022: Once the new directory is created and the virtual enviorment is setup I want this program to activate the VENV.
